              Hello, my name is Andrew Cavallaro. I am currently a Software
              Engineering senior at Florida Gulf Coast University (Wing's Up!)
              and a full-time employee at Gasparilla Island Bridge Authority. I
              received my Associate's in Arts Degree from Hillsborough Community
              College and working towards the completion of my Bachelor's in
              Software Engineering with a minor in Computer Information Systems
              at FGCU. I have a passion for helping people and trying to make
              the universe we all share a greater place. My goal of becoming a
              software engineer is to make things that can make a
              <em>difference</em> in this beautiful world.

                The Arthrex API is my senior project with Arthrex Inc. from Fort
                Myers, FL. Not many details can be shared about this project due
                to an NDA being signed, but the full stack of technologies being
                used are as follows: Docker, ReactJS, Ruby on Rails, PostgreSQL,
                and JSON.

                is an application that I developed using Java 11, JavaFX, and
                the JFoenix library and takes advantage of a MySQL database. It
                is hosted on a local server for access by employees at my
                current place of employment. The main purpose of this project is
                to track the responsibilities of employees, create reports of
                duties completed, and set reminders for tasks that are due today
                and upcoming in the future.

                allows a user to book a reservation at a resort, check in to the
                resort, request additional items during their stay, book
                activities and dinner reservations, check out of the resort, and
                leave feedback for resort employees to view. The application
                also allows for administrators to view vacant rooms, set room
                prices, and view financial reports. It was written using Java
                11, JavaFX, and the JFoenix library.

                tracks the inventory kept within a warehouse and records any
                time production is made. It assigns serial numbers to the items
                and keeps a log of production records. Employees must login with
                a username and password and new employees can be added. The
                system is created using Java 8, JavaFX, and an H2 database.
